# Best-Fit-Line-for-Linear-Regression-using-Excel
To find the best fit line for Linear Regression using the excel scatter plot and to calculate the Residual scores

Best fit line is defined as the one that fits given scatter plot in best way.

Notion for Best fit line is RESIDUALS - Residual is associated with every data point on scatter plot. (Residual is actually the error)

##### ei = Yi - Ypred

where,
Yi - actual data value when x is equal to some values i.e, when x = 2 or x = 6.
Ypred - predicted value on line when x is equal to some value.

The best fit line is obtained by minimising the quantity called Residual Sum of Squares (RSS)

# Best-Fit-Line-for-Linear-Regression-using-Excel
To find the best fit line for Linear Regression using the excel scatter plot and to calculate the Residual scores

Best fit line is defined as the one that fits given scatter plot in best way.

Notion for Best fit line is RESIDUALS - Residual is associated with every data point on scatter plot (Residual is actually the error).

##### ei = Yi - Ypred

where,
Yi - actual data value when x is equal to some values i.e, when x = 2 or x = 6.

Ypred - predicted value on line when x is equal to some value.

The best fit line is obtained by minimising the quantity called Residual Sum of Squares (RSS)

### Steps to Obtain Best Fit Line
1. Plot the scatter plot for Marketing Budget (X) (In lakhs) and Actual Sales(Y) (In crores) columns using excel charts.
2. Using Quick Layout tool draw the straight line through data, the line drawn gives the information of slope and intercept.
3. To calculate the Predicted Sales (Y-pred) use the formula
             Marketing Budget (X) * SLOPE + INTERCEPT
4. RSS value is obtained by squaring the difference of actual Y- axis value and Predicted Y-axis value i.e.,
             (Actual Sales(Y) - Predicted Sales (Y-pred))^2

### Result - Scatter plot with Best Fit Line
